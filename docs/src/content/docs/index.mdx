:::caution
The library and docs are both experimental and heavily under construction! Anything and everything might change at a moment's notice!
:::

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Code without fear" icon="pencil">
		TypeScript will yell at you if something breaks and point to what needs changing!
	</Card>
	<Card title="Packed Enums hold data" icon="list-format">
		Toss an `Enum<Coins>` entry into a `match()` and see the right code magically run!
	</Card>
	<Card title="Results pass errors" icon="random">
		Gently return errors instead of rudely throwing them using `Result<T, E>`
	</Card>
	<Card title="Options are like a gift" icon="star">
		`Option<T>` is a box that can contain something (`T`) or `None`. Unwrap one today to see what's inside!
	</Card>
