Gently return errors instead of rudely throwing them using `Result<T, E>`

## Creating a `Result<T, E>` instance

To create a Result, use the `Ok()` and `Err()` functions.

```ts
import { Ok, Err } from "@oofdere/crabrave";

const ok = Ok<string, number>("success");
const err = Err<string, number>(1);
```

You'll generally want to create `Result<T, E>` instances inside functions and return them, like so:

```ts
import { Ok, Err, Result, Enum, pack } from "@oofdere/crabrave";

type PercentError = {
    DivByZero: number,
    TotalLessThanN: number,
    NegativeResult: number
}

function percent(n: number, total: number): Enum<Result<string, Enum<PercentError>>> {
    const p = n / total * 100;

    if (total < n) return Err(pack("TotalLessThanN", p));
    if (total === 0) return Err(pack("DivByZero", p));
    if (p < 0) return Err(pack("NegativeResult", p));

    return Ok(`${p}%`);
}
```

TypeScript successfully infers all of our return types when using packed enums, so no need to pass generics!

:::note
Make sure to always wrap `Result<T, E>` in `Enum<T>` so the compiler can keep track of it!

```ts
(): Enum<Result<T, E>> // This is good!

(): Result<T, E> // This will not work!
```
:::


## Using a `Result<T, E>` instance

Now let's assume that the `percent()` function we just created is part of a library and we want to use it in our code:

```ts
import { percent } from "percentString";

const half = percent(1, 2); //=> Enum<Result<string, Enum<PercentErrors>>>
console.log(half); // [ "Ok", "50%" ]

const double = percent(2, 1); //=> Enum<Result<string, Enum<PercentErrors>>>
console.log(double); // [ "Err", [ "TotalLessThanN", 200 ] ]
```

:::note
The console logs print the internal representation of Result; that is to say a bog-standard array of size 2, with index 0 containing the status (`Ok` or `Err`), and index 1 containing the actual value (`T` or `E` respectively).

You should generally just use the helper functions listed below, but if you want to, you can index into this directly, albeit without any safety checking.
:::

Notice that despite `half` containing an `Ok` result and `double` containing an `Err` result, they still have the same type.


### `match()`: Verbose but exhaustive

To get our value out of the `Result`, we can use `match()`:

```ts
const half = percent(1, 2);
match(half, {
    Ok: (x) => console.log("ok:", x),
    Err: (x) => console.log("error:", x)
}); // ok: 50%

const double = percent(2, 1);
match(double, {
    Ok: (x) => console.log("ok:", x),
    Err: (x) => console.log("error:", x)
}); // error: [ "TotalLessThanN", 200 ]
```

When our `Err` is an enum, like it is here, we can nest match statements to handle the full chain: 

```ts
const double = percent(2, 1);
match(double, {
    Ok: (x) => console.log("ok:", x),
    Err: (err) => match(err, {
        DivByZero: (x) => console.log("Divided by zero!", `${x}%`),
        TotalLessThanN: (x) => console.log("Total is less than points earned!", `${x}%`),
        NegativeResult: (x) => console.log("Negative percentage!", `${x}%`),
    })
}); // Total is less than points earned! 200%
```

### `unwrap()`: Terse, but explosive

:::caution
Unwrap is useful in a pinch, but please avoid using it in prod! Consider the `or()` method below if you want something that's briefer than `match()`, but still safe.
:::

A simpler, but unsafe way of extracting the value is to use the `unwrap()` function:

```ts
const half = percent(1, 2);
console.log(half.unwrap()); // 50%
```

Really simple, right? Why deal with all the extra code and overhead of that matching nonsense when you can just unwrap your value like a present?

Well, the problem is that this present might throw a grenade at you when you open it:

```ts
const double = percent(2, 1);
console.log(double.unwrap());
```

```bash
TypeError: Err(): TotalLessThanN,200
      at /home/teo/crabrave/src/unwrap.ts:20:7
      at /home/teo/crabrave/examples/percent.ts:24:12
```

You should only use `unwrap()` if you're absolutely, positively sure that the function will not return an `Err`, and it's best saved for prototyping, after which you can replace them with `match()` and `or()` statements to make them safer.

**Avoid `unwrap()` in production.**

### `or()`: A solid middle ground

`or()` is the exact same as `unwrap()`, except that instead of crashing your program when it encounters an `Err` it'll return the fallback value you pass into it:

```ts
const half = percent(1, 2);
console.log(half.or("0%")); // 50%


const double = percent(2, 1);
console.log(double.or("0%")); // 0%
```
