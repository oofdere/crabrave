Gently return errors instead of rudely throwing them using `Result<T, E>`

:::danger
This *almost* works perfectly. Logically, it's fine, but there's a nasty type checking bug that I can't get to the bottom of yet: When `T` and `E` are both of the same type, the arms don't infer the input types.

```ts
const r = Ok<number, number>(0)

// expected types
match(r, {
    Ok: (x) => x, //=> (x: number) => number
    Err: (x) => console.log(x) //=> (x: number) => void
})

// bugged types
match(r, {
    Ok: (x) => x, //=> (x: any) => number
    Err: (x) => console.log(x) //=> (x: any) => void
})
```

Logically this still works, but TypeScript will be calling you an idiot sandwich.

If you use two sufficiently different types (type aliases have the same issue, for instance) the issue goes away, even if those types are `number` and `Number`:

```ts
const r = Ok<number, Number>(0)

// works perfectly fine for some reason!
match(r, {
    Ok: (x) => x, //=> (x: number) => number
    Err: (x) => console.log(x) //=> (x: Number) => void
})
```

I have no idea why this happens but it's unacceptable and fixing it is my main priority right now.

## Creating a `Result<T, E>` instance

To create a Result, use the `Ok()` and `Err()` functions.

```ts
import { Ok, Err } from "@oofdere/crabrave";

const ok = Ok<string, number>("success");
const err = Err<string, number>(1);
```

You'll generally want to create `Result<T, E>` instances inside functions and return them, like so:

```ts
import { Ok, Err, Resultm Enum, pack } from "@oofdere/crabrave";

type PercentError = {
    DivByZero: number,
    TotalLessThanN: number,
    NegativeResult: number
}

function percent(n: number, total: number): Result<number, Enum<PercentError>> {
    const p = n / total * 100;

    if (total < n) return Err(pack("TotalLessThanN", p));
    if (total === 0) return Err(pack("DivByZero", p));
    if (p < 0) return Err(pack("NegativeResult", p));

    return Ok(p);
```

TypeScript successfully infers all of our return types when using packed enums, so no need to pass generics!

## Using a `Result<T, E>` instance

Now let's assume that we're using the `percent()` function we just created in a library:

```ts
import { percent } from "percentString";

const half = percent(1, 2); //=> Result<string, PercentErrors>
console.log(half); // "Ok"

const double = percent(2, 1); //=> Result<string, PercentErrors>
console.log(double); // "Err"
```

Notice that despite `half` containing an `Ok` result and `double` containing an `Err` result, they still have the same type.

To get our value out of the `Result`, we can use `match()`:

```ts
const half = percent(1, 2); //=> Result<string, PercentErrors>
const half_str = match(half, {
    Ok: (x) => `${x}%`,
    Err: () => "Something went wrong."
})
console.log(half_str) // "50%"
```

### `unwrap()`: Useful in a pinch, but please don't use it in prod

A simpler, but unsafe way of extracting the value is to use the `unwrap()` function:

```ts

```

Really simple, right? Why deal with all the extra code and overhead of that matching nonsense when you can just unwrap your value like a present?

Well, the problem is that this present might throw a grenade at you when you open it:

```ts

```

You should only use `unwrap()` if you're absolutely, positively sure that the function will not return an `Err`, and it's best saved for prototyping, after which you can replace them with `match()` statements to make them safer.

Avoid `unwrap()` in production.
